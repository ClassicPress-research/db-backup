My to-do list

I am not using GitHub issues at this stage because the architecture is a bit fluid, especially with regards to
restoration. Tasks here won't make much sense to anyone but me. Sorry...

Missing engine features
========================================================================================================================
Sort tables and views in the Database part
    I could abstract this in a way which allows me to use proper dependency tracking later (future-proofing FTW)
    This requires passing an array of table meta to a method and get a sorted list back
SQL file splitting with manual limits
    Currently we only do auto-detection. Add a Configuration property maxFileSize for maximum SQL file size.
    Setter: if maxFileSize is smaller than maxQuerySize lower maxQuerySze to maxFileSize

Unit Tests
========================================================================================================================
Engine\Core\Action\Table\GetCreate
Engine\Core\Filter\Data\* (see how I tested filters in Akeeba Replace)
Engine\Core\Part\Database
Engine\Core\Part\Table

Restoration
========================================================================================================================
Adapt DB restoration code from Akeeba ANGIE into the Database package + Unit Tests
Create

Plugin
========================================================================================================================
The entire GUI :)
WP-CLI integration
    Now, how do you Unit Test *that*?

Other testing
========================================================================================================================
Selenium testing of backup
Selenium testing of restoration

Caveat: selenium-standalone + Firefox is currently (Jan 2019) broken w/out any sign of improvement. This limits
testing to Chrome.

Stretch goals -- These are nice-to-haves but not part of the MVP
========================================================================================================================
User-defined table and table data filters
User-defined row filters
Allow advanced filtering on all of the above with regular expressions
Create and use compressed SQL files (probably requires support for GZip stream in PHP?)
