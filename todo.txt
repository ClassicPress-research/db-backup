My to-do list

I am not using GitHub issues at this stage because the architecture is a bit fluid, especially with regards to
restoration. Tasks here won't make much sense to anyone but me. Sorry...

Unit Tests
========================================================================================================================
Engine\Core\Filter\Data\* (see how I tested filters in Akeeba Replace)
Engine\Core\Part\Database
Engine\Core\Part\Table

Restoration
========================================================================================================================
Adapt DB restoration code from Akeeba ANGIE into the Database package + Unit Tests
Create

Plugin
========================================================================================================================
The entire GUI :)
    Do Unit Tests make for the GUI or just Selenium (see below)

Other testing
========================================================================================================================
Selenium testing of backup
Selenium testing of restoration

Caveat: selenium-standalone + Firefox is currently (Jan 2019) broken w/out any sign of improvement. This limits
testing to Chrome.

Stretch goals -- These are nice-to-haves but not part of the MVP
========================================================================================================================
User-defined table and table data filters
User-defined row filters
Dependency tracking for sorting tables
    Create new Table filter (like Sorter) which uses table dependency tracking to order the tables and views.
Allow advanced filtering on all of the above with regular expressions
Create and use compressed SQL files (probably requires support for GZip stream in PHP?)
WP-CLI integration
    Now, how do you Unit Test *that*?
SQL file splitting with manual limits
    Currently we only do auto-detection. Add a Configuration property maxFileSize for maximum SQL file size.
    Setter: if maxFileSize is smaller than maxQuerySize lower maxQuerySze to maxFileSize
    Why is this stretch goal: you only need to split SQL files if your host doesn't let you go full size.
